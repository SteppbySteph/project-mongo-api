# Project Mongo API

The purpuose of this project is to learn how to use Mongodb to store data, and how to query that data from your API.
The endpoints you can look for are: 

../books 
../books/:id

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?
There have been issues deploying the project with heroku. At the beginning the problem was solved after adding a key/value to the "config var" in Heroku and then I had to sign up to a mongo cloud to be able to upload my new dataset.
